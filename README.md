**Bank Account Management System - Developer Portfolio**

## Overview

As a freelance software developer with a strong background in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), I take pride in my contribution to the Bank Account Management System. Leveraging my expertise in OOP principles and best practices, I played a key role in designing and implementing a robust and user-friendly banking application.

## My OOP Experience

Throughout my career, I have gained extensive experience in developing applications using OOP concepts, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. I believe in creating clean, modular, and maintainable code, which aligns with the fundamental principles of OOP. My proficiency in analyzing complex problems and translating them into efficient software solutions has been the cornerstone of my success as a developer.

## Contributions to the Bank Account Management System

### OOP Design

- Designed the object-oriented architecture of the Bank Account Management System, defining classes and their relationships to ensure a flexible and scalable application.
- Employed UML diagrams, including class diagrams and sequence diagrams, to visualize interactions between objects and the application's behavior.

### Implementation

- Implemented the `Account` class, encapsulating essential attributes such as account number, user name, balance, and withdrawal limit.
- Developed robust methods for depositing and withdrawing funds, with thorough error handling to ensure data integrity and security.
- Designed a private method to verify the available withdrawal amount, adhering to the principle of information hiding.

### Code Quality

- Ensured code quality and maintainability through consistent adherence to coding standards and best practices.
- Conducted comprehensive unit testing of class methods to validate their correctness and efficiency.

### Documentation

- Authored detailed technical documentation, including code comments and explanatory notes, to facilitate easy understanding and maintenance of the application.

### Collaboration

- Worked collaboratively with stakeholders, including business analysts and testers, to gather requirements, provide status updates, and address feedback during the development process.

### Method Relationships

The following textual representation illustrates how the methods are connected to the `Account` class:
